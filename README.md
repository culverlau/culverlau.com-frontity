# tutorial-hello-frontity

This is the project as explained in the Step By Step tutorial available at [tutorial.frontity.org](tutorial.frontity.org)

### Accessing the steps of the tutorial

Every [commit](https://github.com/frontity-demos/tutorial-hello-frontity/commits/main) in the repo corresponds to a step in the tutorial. [These commits are tagged](https://github.com/frontity-demos/tutorial-hello-frontity/tags) using the formula "StepX.X"

So, once you have cloned your repository by running (for example)

```
git clone https://github.com/frontity-demos/tutorial-hello-frontity.git
```

you'll get the final version of the project, but you can go to a specific step of the tutorial by executing:

```
git checkout Step4.1
```

The list of available tags (steps()) that can be used with `git checkout` is [here](https://github.com/frontity-demos/tutorial-hello-frontity/tags)

To return to the final version you can execute:

```
git checkout main
```

### Launch a development server

```
npx frontity dev
```

Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The site will automatically reload if you make changes inside the `packages` folder. You will see the build errors in the console.
